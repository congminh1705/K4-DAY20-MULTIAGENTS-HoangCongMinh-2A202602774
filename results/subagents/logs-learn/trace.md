### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/app.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-01T03:04:05Z", "service": "payment-service", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "Charge failed order=991", "exception": "ValueError: invalid card number", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"payment-service": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR or CRITICAL (any capitalisation). Do not include WARN/WARNING/INFO/DEBUG entries.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after `<service>: ` on the first line of the entry.
- `exception` is the last line of the traceback attached to the entry, or `null` if the entry has no traceback.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.

# app.log - format

Each log entry starts with a line:

    <timestamp> [<LEVEL>] <service>: <message>

- `timestamp` is ISO-8601 with a UTC offset (`+07:00`, `-05:00` or `Z`).
- Levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN/WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. Level names are not always written in upper case.
- An entry can be followed by extra lines (for example a Python traceback). Those lines belong to the entry above them.
- A line `-- last message repeated N times --` means the entry above it (together with its extra lines) occurred N more times.

### Tool result
I have successfully written the Python script (`workspace/parse_log.py`), parsed `workspace/app.log` following all rules and README instructions, generated `workspace/errors.json`, and run validation checks.

### Summary of Changes & Outcomes:
- **Created Script:** `workspace/parse_log.py`
- **Generated File:** `workspace/errors.json`
- **Checks Performed:** 
  - Filtered entries to only include `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` levels (case-insensitive in source).
  - Converted timestamps to UTC and formatted them as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
  - Extracted service names and messages correctly.
  - Attached the last line of the traceback or `null` if no traceback existed.
  - Calculated `repeat_count` accurately accounting for `-- last message repeated N times --` lines.
  - Aggregated `counts_by_service` per service.
